Hanoi
=====

Hanoi is a very simple (crude) demonstration of recursive programming. Because the amount of steps required to solve a Tower of Hanoi increases exponentially by a factor of 2, and those steps invert themselves around the auxiliary peg, a Tower of Hanoi can be solved by simply doing the same steps recursively before and after the central step.
